* Call for Papers

We invite submissions in the form of an abstract of 200-300
words. Talks can be on experiences of using functional languages in
numerical applications and also on theoretical aspects of numerical
computing in functional languages.

Topics of interest include (but not limited to):

 * Embedded domain specific languages for expressing numerical
   problems and generating efficient code e.g. generating llvm Ã  la
   Julia / Haskell accelerate
 * Use of types to ensure static correctness of matrix and higher rank
   computations e.g. use Naperian aka representable functors for
   statically typed APL-like programming
 * Dynamical systems / solving systems of ODEs
 * PDEs using e.g. grid-based methods, method of characteristics,
   method of lines
 * Inferring parameters for statistical models using techniques such
   as Sequential Monte Carlo / Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
 * Data exploration, reproducibility
 * Use of e.g SMT theorem proving, interval and affine arithmetic and
   function derivatives to prove error bounds for programs using
   floating point arithmetic
 * Formal verification of numerical analysis programs for example
   using e.g the Coq proof assistant
 * Global approximation methods by e.g. Chebyshev polynomials
 * Compiler optimisations
 * Exact real arithmetic / interval arithmetic / ball arithmetic
 * Using type systems to annotate values with physical units

In case it is not obvious, all submissions should be related to
numerical methods and functional programming.
